I want 3 programming projects on each chapter. 
The students do know Rust basics and are familiar with programming concepts and algorithms


Give problems statement for each project
Add 'why it matters' and 'use cases' to each project

Give an outline for a solution, but do not give complete implementation, make it didactically interesting

Give hints how it can be tested

Write it as markdown in a ../workbook directory

Give the projects some (6) stepping stones and checks/tests for less experienced programmers 

For each next step tell why the previous step is not enough and why we need another step tell what the improvement is (especially on optimization step; speed, memory, parallellism)

look at workbook/workbook-projects.md for previous project subject 
at new project on different subjects


on each milestone start with an introdction then the names of structs/traits, the fields and the functions with the role they play the 'checkpoint tests' and thebn do the 'starter code' 


in the projects on each milestone do a introduction  after 'checkpoint tests' then 'starter code'
>>>>>>> External Changes

put a complete working example at the end the project

write the projects in 3 separate files

start with src/18-smart-pointers
