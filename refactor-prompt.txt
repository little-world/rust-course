this is the first chapter from a book for experience programmer "patterns in rust"
can you give me suggestions how the improve it


 refactor the file
make the introduction of each pattern: Problem - Solution - Why it matters - Use cases
more readable

refactor the rust code examples so that the pattern sections will become
  separate example with a small introduction and explanation
  
 start with chapter 04-builder
