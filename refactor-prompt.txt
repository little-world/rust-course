this is the first chapter from a book for experience programmer "patterns in rust"
can you give me suggestions how the improve it


rewrite the file: 12-hashmap
make the introduction of each pattern: Problem - Solution - Why it matters - Use cases
more readable

 rewrite the file so that the pattern sections in de rust code will become
  separate example with a small introduction and explanation
  
  
do not remove examples

04-generics*
rewrite the projects Starter Code so that it does not hold the solution but only an outline in the form of //TODO's 
give a complete solution at the end of the project
